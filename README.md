This repostiory contains the data and code for a project where I attempted to answer the question: does there exist a quantitative relationship between the financial ratios and stock return of a company? Data on hundreds of financial ratios were collected on 55 different American companies from years 2010-2019. Tidied data, created multiple linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost models in R code. After analyzing our models we were unable to determine a relationship between financial ratios and stock retrun.
